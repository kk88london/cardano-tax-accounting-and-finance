Hello World! 
That is the first thing that I learned to programme while at UCL studying computer science in 2001, before I dropped out, struggled with depression for a few years and then became an Accountant.
I am totally new to GitHub, so please be patient while I learn how this thing works
You can find me on steemit

Thanks for reading and I am excited to be going on this journey with all you very forward thinking people.
